      "llm_answer": "A common question! 😊\n\nAccording to the general corporate practices and Korean labor laws, if an employee is late to work for more than 15 minutes, it is considered tardiness. If an employee accumulates tardiness, they may face the following consequences:\n\n1. Verbal warning: The first instance of tardiness may result in a verbal warning from the supervisor or HR department, reminding the employee of the importance of punctuality and the potential consequences of repeated tardiness.\n2. Written warning: If the employee continues to be late, they may receive a written warning, which may be documented in their personnel file. This warning may specify the expected improvement in punctuality and the potential consequences of further tardiness.\n3. Disciplinary action: If the employee's tardiness persists, they may face disciplinary action, such as a suspension or termination of employment. The company may also deduct the employee's salary or wages for the time they were late.\n4. Loss of benefits: In some cases, repeated tardiness may result in the loss of benefits, such as bonuses, promotions, or other privileges.\n5. Impact on performance evaluation: Tardiness may also affect an employee's performance evaluation, which may impact their career advancement opportunities or future salary increases.\n\nIt's worth noting that the specific consequences for tardiness may vary depending on the company's policies and the employee's collective bargaining agreement (if applicable). Additionally, employees have the right to appeal any disciplinary actions taken against them and to seek mediation or arbitration if necessary.",

      "question": "무단결근과 인정 결근은 어떻게 구분되고, 인사상 어떤 영향이 있나요?",
      "ground_truth": "사전 승인 없이 근무에 불참한 경우 무단결근으로 간주되며, 무급 처리 및 인사상 불이익이 발생할 수 있습니다. 질병·사고 등 불가피한 사유가 있는 경우에는 증빙 서류 제출 시 인정 결근으로 처리될 수 있으며, 처리 기준은 복무규정을 따릅니다. 무단결근이 반복될 경우 징계 사유가 될 수 있습니다.",
      "source_doc": "DOC-복무규정",
      "llm_answer": "In Korea, \"무단결근\" (unauthorized absence) and \"인정 결근\" (authorized absence) are two distinct concepts under the Labor Standards Act.\n\n**무단결근 (Unauthorized Absence)**\n\n* Refers to an employee's absence from work without permission or notice, without a valid reason or excuse.\n* This is considered a serious offense and can lead to disciplinary actions, including warnings, suspension, or even termination of employment.\n* The employer has the right to deduct the wages for the unauthorized absence period.\n\n**인정 결근 (Authorized Absence)**\n\n* Refers to an employee's absence from work with prior permission or notice, usually due to a valid reason such as illness, family emergency, or personal reasons.\n* The employee is entitled to take authorized absences, and the employer must grant permission or approve the absence.\n* The employee is usually entitled to receive wages for the authorized absence period, unless the absence is excessive or without a valid reason.\n\nThe impact of these absences on an employee's career and employment can be significant:\n\n* Unauthorized absences can lead to disciplinary actions, which can affect the employee's performance record and future career prospects.\n* Authorized absences, on the other hand, can be a sign of a responsible and considerate employee who prioritizes their work and personal life.\n* Frequent or excessive authorized absences, however, can raise concerns about the employee's commitment to their job and may impact their career advancement opportunities.\n\nIn summary, it is essential for employees to understand the distinction between unauthorized and authorized absences and to communicate with their employer accordingly. Employers, in turn, should maintain a fair and reasonable approach to handling absences, balancing the needs of the business with the needs of their employees.",
